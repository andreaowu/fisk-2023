Hi all! I've been at Google (in the Seattle office) ever since I graduated from the University of Washington in 2015. I've worked as a software engineer on Cloud UI widgets, Google Maps user generated content, and now Google Maps core data focused on buildings. However, the work I'm most proud of at Google is my time as the GIR at Fisk in 2022. I'm so excited to get the chance to connect with students again this year and help y'all master CS fundamentals.
