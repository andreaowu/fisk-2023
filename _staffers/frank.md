Hi everyone, my name is Frank and I'm excited to be a TA for this course. I'm excited to help you learn the basics of CS! I took CSCI 110 last fall and it was an amazing experience. I hope it will be the same for you too.
I'm looking forward to working with you all and helping you learn Python. I'll be available during office hours to answer your questions and help you with your assignments. I'm also happy to meet with you one-on-one if you need extra help.
Let's get started!
