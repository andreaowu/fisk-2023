Hello! I'm Frank, a Sophomore and a CS Major from Nigeria. Iâ€™m excited to be a TA for this course and I'm equally excited to help you learn the basics of CS. I took CSCI 110 last fall and it was an amazing experience! I hope it will be the same for you too. I look forward to working with everyone this Fall semester.
