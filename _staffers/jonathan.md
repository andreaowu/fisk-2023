Hello! I am Jonathan. I am originally from DR Congo; moved here to the US as an international student. I am a software engineer here at Google for Google Play and have been working here for about a year now; It's my first full time job after graduating from college last year. Some of my hobbies are working out, playing basketball, piano, and hiking.  I am very excited about this opportunity and look forward to working with you all!
