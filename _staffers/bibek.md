Hello there! I'm Bibek Gaire, and I'm an international student from Nepal. I'm currently a junior, and my main focus is Computer Science. I remember struggling a bit with CSCI 110 when I was a student, but fortunately, the teaching assistant (TA) in the class was a big help in clearing up my confusion. I totally get how you might be feeling, so don't hesitate to ask me anything – seriously, no question is too small. I'm also a Career Peer Mentor at the Office of Career Planning and Development, which means I'm here to support you beyond just the classroom stuff. If you've got any questions, I'm here and ready to help. I'm really excited to be your TA for CSCI 110 – let's make this learning journey awesome!
