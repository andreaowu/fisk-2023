Hi, my name is Angel and I am a junior majoring in Computer Science. I am excited to be your TA in this course because this was my favourite course at Fisk, and I hope to help you all have a great experience in it as well. I have completed two summer internships at Google and I am the outreach coordinator for the Fisk CS club. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions, concerns, or just for a casual chat!
