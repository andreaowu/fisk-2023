## Overview
CSCI 110 is an introductory class designed for students with no formal exposure to computer science or programming. The goal is to provide a gentle but thorough introduction to computer science that will prepare students to either take further computer science courses or use computer science in their field of study.

By the end of the course, students will learn
 - Variables, Expressions, Types
 - Input/Output
 - Logic and Control Flow
 - Functions
 - Lists, Dictionaries, Sets
 - Testing, Asserts
 - Runtime and efficiency
 - Objects and Classes

## Course Meetings
Lectures, labs, and office hours are the main ways in which you will interact with your professor and TAs. You can see the weekly schedule of course meetings on the [course schedule page](schedule.md).

### Lecture
Lectures, labs, and office hours are the main ways in which you will interact with your professor and TAs. You can see the weekly schedule of course meetings on the course calendar page. Lectures and labs will be held in Library 317. Instructor office hours will be held on the Library 3rd floor at this time until an office has been assigned.

This class will use a flipped classroom model, where lecture videos will be sent out before class that you must watch. You will be expected to have watched the videos the day before class and completed the associated assignment. Classtime will then be spent on answering student questions on the material and working through practice problems. You are expected to come to each class, having watched the lecture videos, as there will be weekly quizzes given at a random time during class.

### Labs
// TODO
Labs will let you apply the new concepts that you're learning in lecture to broader, graded problems. You will be given problems to solve that you'll be able to work on with your peers in groups of 4. 

You should take advantage of labs as you can ask the professor or TAs for help on completing the assignments. 

### Office Hours
// TODO
We will hold a mixture of in-person and virtual office hours at a wide variety of times. Virtual office hours will be held on Zoom, the link can be found at the [course schedule page](schedule.md). In-person office hours will be held in Andrea's office. You are welcome to come for any reason, including course material questions, lecture clarifications, industry interview prep, career path discussions, or just to hang out. 

As a course, we commit to making sure no student fails the class due to lack of class resources, so if you are behind or confused, please reach out for help. The course staff will make themselves as available as possible to help you.

## Policies

### Grades
// TODO
Your final grade will be calculated based on your exams, homeworks, labs, projects, and quizzes. See the section below for a detailed breakdown. Depending on the difficulty of the material, a curve may be applied to increase grades at the end of the semester. A curve will never be used to decrease grades.

Your overall grade will be calculated using the following relative weights:

| Assignment Type | # of Assignments | Number Dropped | Weight in Overall Grade |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|:------|
| Midterm Exam(s) | 2 | 0  | 23% |
| Final Exam | 1 | 0  | 17% |
| Homeworks | 5 | 0  | 15% |
| Labs | 12 | 2  | 23% |
| Projects | 2 | 0 | 17% |
| Quiz | 8 | 1 | 5% |

### Assignments
// TODO
These details are subject to change during the semester, however the current plan of record is the following:

- ~8 Quizzes - random time during lecture time, once a week. 
- 12 Labs - 1x per week. Work w/ partners, submit individually
- 5 Homeworks - spread throughout the semester. Work individually, submit individually.
- 2 Projects - Image Filters and Search Engine

Assignments will be due at 11:59pm, with a 10% penalty per each day that the assignment is late up to 5 days total.

### Exams
Instead of one midterm and one final exam, this course will have 3 exams, spaced evenly across the semester, with the third exam happening during finals week. Exam 1 will be on Wednesday, September 22nd. Exam 2 is will be on Monday, November 1st. Exam 3 will take place during finals week. 

### Cheating
// TODO
For all assignments in the course, you may discuss approaches to solving a problem or work in the same room on separate computers to individually solve a problem, but **you may *not* copy and paste code or substantially copy ideas from another student**. It can be tempting to cheat. Know that Mimir's autograder has a very good plagiarism detector. Per Howard University policy, the first time an assignment is found to be plagiarized, the assignment grade will be zero-ed out for all students with matching code. The second time, all students involved will have their final course grade decreased by 1 letter grade (B going to a C, A- does to a B-, etc.). The third time, all students involved will be referred to the Dean's office for academic dishonesty. 

If I ask you how your code works and you do not know, it will be evident that you have copied it. Don't take the risk. Despite this explicit warning, each year, a few students still cheat and are caught. I do not enjoy catching and penalizing students for plagiarism, but it's necessary for 

The course staff will work tirelessly to provide enough support for any student to get help and make it through the class. In exchange, we ask you to uphold academic integrity and not to plagiarize code or ideas.

## Resources
// TODO
