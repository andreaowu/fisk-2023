About the Class
CSCI110 is an introductory class designed for students with no formal exposure to computer science or programming. The goal is to provide a gentle but thorough introduction to computer science that will prepare students to either take further computer science courses or use computer science in their field of study.

See the Syllabus page for more details on course policies.
